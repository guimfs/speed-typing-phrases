What's happened to the water.
Our water's going bad.
My love winks she does not bother.
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
You're the book that I have opened.
Sweeter than wine, softer than a summer's night.
My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue.
Carry on. Love is coming Love is coming to us all.
You make me happy with the things you do.
And I'll come running to tie your shoe.
Sweet name, you're born once again for me.
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band.
You can normalize. Don't it make you feel alive?
The resolution. Of all the fruitless searches.
Today your love, tomorrow the world!
The only girl I've ever loved. Was born with roses in her eyes.
I'm gonna love you. Till the heaven stops the rain.
So you find yourself somebody. Who can do the job for free.
You can't always get what you want.
